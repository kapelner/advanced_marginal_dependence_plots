- Fix the 'rug' which is all f**ed up and frequently says stuff like "some values will be clipped"
   also it seems to be blatantly WRONG in some cases. 
- Decide what to do with the 'click-to-center' business.
- Add SDs in the partial plot, should they be binned?
- Decide if we want to do clustering for the derivatives.  Currrently this isn't allowed because
  clustering expects an amdp object but it wouldn't be hard. 
- plot.damdp needs to be checked with all it's arguments turned on and off...
- MAN files bitches.
